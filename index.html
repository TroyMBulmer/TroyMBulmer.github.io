			My name is Troy. I am a student at St. lawrence cornwall.
			I am 23 years old and in case it was not obvious i do not like talking about my self. 
			I was born in markham lived in Ottawa, Toronto, Mississauga, back to markham, now in kingston
			I have 3 siblings, 4 cousins and I am the oldest of all of them (its less fun than one might think)
		<br>
			I enjoy playing videogames, reading, Dungeons and dragons in my spare time
			My favorite movies are the Star Wars saga(all of them i dont care what others say) the james bond series
			and green is my favorite color
		<br>
			I am not a fan of apples, or the color pink. 
		<br>
			I belive that what someone does is more important than what someone says.
